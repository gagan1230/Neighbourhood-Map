## Project Overview

#### Why this Project?
The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

#### What will I Learn?
You will learn how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. You’ll then explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally, you’ll implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.

#### How does this help my Career?
